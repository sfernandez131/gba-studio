# GBA runtime tests (quality program part 2b).
#
# Boots the built gba_actor_test ROM headlessly under mGBA's GDB stub and asserts
# engine behavior with gdb-multiarch - the automated form of the manual GDB-stub
# verification recipe (see the project's toolchain notes). Everything asserted here
# is symbol-stable: function-entry registers (AAPCS r0-r3) and the exported
# script_memory global; anonymous-namespace statics are avoided (LTO can strip
# their symbols).
#
# The fixture script under test (examples/gba_actor_test, main scene init):
#   1. launches a projectile RIGHT (angle 64) then DOWN (angle 128),
#   2. swaps the player spritesheet,
#   3. opens a two-option Choice (options=3: LAST_0|CANCEL_B, count=2),
#   4. opens a six-item Menu (count=6).
# Selections are forced with GDB `return` (no key injection over the stub); the
# results must land in script_memory[0] and [1].
#
# Usage: gba-runtime-test.sh <rom.gba> <gbavm.elf>
